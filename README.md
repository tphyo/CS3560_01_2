# Asian Fusion Kiosk
Ever since the pandemic became a clear threat, concerns about how local restaurants will survive grew. Restaurants started to use different methods to minimize human contact such as delivering food, taking phone orders for pick-up, or having outdoor dine-in. Our restaurant is an old restaurant that hasnâ€™t modernized, cannot afford a contactless ordering system, and wants to focus on avoiding dine-in. As a result, a solution would be creating a kiosk-like system for customers to order food, pay, wait, and leave happily with their food. This will open another route to order food, and it will prevent additional interaction. For now, the order system will be placed in a kiosk, but future
developments may lead to the creation of an app or a website.
